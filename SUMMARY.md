## What Was Wrong With the Old Portfolio (testportfolio-main)

As a senior UX designer reviewing your previous portfolio, here were the critical issues:

❌ **Wrong Focus**: Coding tricks (drawer animation, file tabs) instead of UX work
❌ **Bad UX**: Metaphor-based navigation made users hunt for content
❌ **Hid Your Work**: Animations created friction between recruiters and your projects
❌ **Over-Engineered**: Fixed 1920x1080 canvas, complex positioning, fragile on devices
❌ **Missing UX Process**: No demonstration of design thinking or problem-solving
❌ **Generic Positioning**: Didn't showcase you as a UX/UI designer

### Decision: Shelved ✓
**You made the right call.** That project would have worked against you in UX job applications.
